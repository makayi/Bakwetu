# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Step up all the node Js modules and frameworks needed.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with choosing what framework to use but at the end of the day I picked the right ones.
### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Managed to get the sign up page working, it can send data to the Node JS server using Angular JS.

**Thoughts:** Coding wise I struggled a bit with Angular JS but the good part is that I had some resources I could use for referencing. Then when it came to pushing the code, my local repository had issues pushing the code but thanks to the help of my friend Kampamba I managed to get it working.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I decided to follow a tutorial on implementing  Authentication for a MEAN Stack App. Managed to step all the necessary Services, Controllers on the Angular JS side of things. Plus I added the Passport, jwt-simple modules to help handle the Authentication using tokens.

**Thoughts:** I really did know much about what I was doing when I started following the tutorial, plus Angular JS was flagging off some errors that I didn't know but I managed to figure it out at the end. It was dependency inject misspelling problem.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I had some great progress, after successfully implementing user Authentication, I decided to connect the front end with the backend. The user is now able to register ,login and view their information. I have implemented secure routes or pages that can only be seen by authorized user. The interface is still basic but it is functional.

**Thoughts:** For the interface I have had to learn a bit of foundation but am struggling with it a bit. To be honest this project has made me realize that I am more of backend programmer than I wish to admit. Anyways am still trying to get the basic things working before I can focus of the interface of the project.

### Day 5: January 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I decided to use the Angular Material framework as the  primary UI framework sincce  the app is already using Angular JS.

**Thoughts:** It is has been a interesting learning curve, been trying to figure out how to do it properly.

### Day 6: January 12, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Finally implemented the dashboard with a side navigation and a message list panel using the Angular Material. I have also managed to figure out how to nest states and views using UI-Router.

**Thoughts:** It was quite challenging finding the right tutorials to set up the look I was going for. Even though Angular Material is great framework I feel like the developer community is not that active, tutorials are not that many.
