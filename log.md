# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Step up all the node Js modules and frameworks needed.

**Today's Progress**: Managed to get the sign up page working, it can send data to the Node JS server using Angular JS.

**Thoughts:** Coding wise I struggled a bit with Angular JS but the good part is that I had some resources I could use for referencing. Then when it came to pushing the code, my local repository had issues pushing the code but thanks to the help of my friend Kampamba I managed to get it working.
